1. Create 2+ ​existence​ assertions. Example, “Every record has a date field”.
- Every record has a CRASH_ID.
- Every record has a field or set of fields that can be used to compose the crash date.
+ No 'crash' type records have a vehicle id.
+ All 'crash' type records have serial numbers.


2. Create 2+ ​limit​ assertions. The values of most numeric fields should fall within a
valid range. Example: “the date field should be between 1/1/2019 and
12/31/2019 inclusive”
- The HWY_NO field will be no more than 3 characters.
- The AGE_VAL will be a two character field.
+ The Crash Month value ( when present ) will be between 1-12
+ If the 'marijuana used' field is available it will be between 0-3 || 9.


3. Create 2+ ​intra-record check​ assertions.
- The VHCL_OCCUP_CNT will be > 0.
- The record has a crash date, month, and year that should match the CRASH_DT field.
+ The alcohol involved flag will either be blank | 0 | 1 | 9
+ Vehicle records will have a hit & run flag value of either 0 | 1


4. Create 2+ ​inter-record check​ assertions.
- Every CRASH_ID has an associated SER_NO.
- Every VHCL_ID is associated with one or more CRASH_IDs
+ All the participant records will have a participant ID
+ All the crash records will have a light condition value between 0-5

5. Create 2+ ​summary​ assertions. Example: “every crash has a unique ID”
- Every record has a unique VHCL_ID value
- Every record has a CMPSS_DIR_FROM_CD which is one of N|S|E|W
+ Every crash record has a weather condition value between 0-9
+ Every vehicle record has a vehicle ownership value between 0-9

6. Create 2+ referential integrity insertions. Example “every crash participant has a
Crash ID of a known crash”
- Every VHCL_ID has one or more associated CRASH_ID values. ! DUPLICATE of 4.2
- Every record has a CNTY_NM ( county name ) that corresponds to a county in Oregon State. ! This field is not a column in the excel doc
+ Every crash record where the roundabout value is 1, will also have a off roadway value 1
+ Every crash record that has an intersection related value of 1, will also have an intersection type value ( non-blank )

7. Create 2+ ​statistical distribution assertions.​ Example: “crashes are
evenly/uniformly distributed throughout the year.”
- Crashes are less prevalent during the middle of the week (e.g. Tue-Thur)
- The distribution of crashes will be skewed towards the end/beginning of the calendar year.
+ Light conditions for crashes will skew towards non-daylight ( 2-3 )
+ Road surface conditions for crashes will skew towards non-dry surfaces ( 2-4 )
